<p><ul><li>Proportional Reinsurance</li><li>Non-proportional Reinsurance</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The marine reinsurance market comprises two primary types: proportional and non-proportional reinsurance. Proportional reinsurance involves sharing premiums and losses between the primary insurer and reinsurer based on agreed percentages, providing predictable risk management.
